# Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

*Author: Grace Campbell*

## Problem Statement

The SAT and ACT are the two most widely-administered standardized tests in the United States used to help universities make admissions decisions about incoming students. Across the 50 states, there is a wide range of average participation rates for both tests. Which states are lacking the most in test participation, and what actions can be taken to increase participation in these states?

## Data Summary

I have been given data from the SAT and ACT tests from 2017 and 2018. These data include average scores from each test as well as participation rates for each state.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on my outside research, I would recommend several things to increase SAT participation in North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. First, local school boards should designate one day during the school year in which students can sign up for and take the SAT through their high school. Making the test more accessible and convenient for students will increase participation. 

Secondly, there should be some sort of fee assistance offered for the SAT. If the students are more easily able to pay for the cost of taking the SAT, they may be more likely to take the test.

The third, and most comprehensive, recommendation is that these states make the SAT required for high school students. If the test is required, then participation will most certainly increase. However, this recommendation may not be the most reasonable. These states already require the ACT, so there may not be much incentive for them to require the SAT as well.

Overall, these states should encourage students to take both tests. Students may find that one test better demonstrates their skills than the other, and that they may score comparatively higher on one test than the other. A higher SAT or ACT test score means a higher chance of college admissions, and this point should be emphasized to all students to encourage them to take both tests.
